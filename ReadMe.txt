DevPunk Is an attempt to combine alot of the flashpunk/punkui/ogmo level code / snippets into a gigantic lib to start from for noobies like myself. :]
-Robert Chubb

Sorry if there are deleted comments or some changed code in some files, I do it for readability on my part as i dev, I'll update the files once i'm finished with the first revision
This is not a final product im not  for damages ect.. ect..

Thanks to everyone for FlashPunk, PunkUI, Ogmo Support, Code Snippets, [will edit more later]
