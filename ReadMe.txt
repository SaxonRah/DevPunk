DevPunk Album [http://imgur.com/a/D9oI7#0]
The goal of DevPunk is to one day create an easy interface with
ActionScript/FlashPunk/PunkUI/Box2Dto house PunkUI World Instancing.
DevPunk Is an attempt to combine alot of the flashpunk/punkui/ogmo level code / 
snippets into a gigantic lib to start from for noobies like myself. :] 
Sorry if there are deleted comments or some changed code in some files.
I do it for readability on my part as i dev, I'll update the files once i'm finished with the first revision
This is not a final product im not  for damages ect.. ect.. 

You can view the latest demo here [https://github.com/kgbkgb/DevPunk/blob/master/bin/OgmoFlashPunkUI.swf?raw=true]

Thanks to everyone for FlashPunk, PunkUI, Ogmo Support, Code Snippets, [will edit more later]
