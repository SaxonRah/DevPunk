The goal of DevPunk is to use it as a prototyping tool to test new functionality for systems in other languages. 
DevPunk Is an attempt to combine alot of the flashpunk/punkui/ogmo level code / 
snippets from the fourms and blogs around the net into a gigantic lib to start from for noobies like myself. :] 
Sorry if there are deleted comments or some changed code in some files. - 
This is not a final product im not responsible for damages ect..ect..
I could careless about legal stuff, I'm not trying to make money or destroy your pc. 
I'm doing this as a side project so don't expect a whole lot.

Thanks to everyone for FlashPunk, PunkUI, Ogmo Support, Bloom and Blur Punk, Splash & Code Snippets -- [will add more later]
